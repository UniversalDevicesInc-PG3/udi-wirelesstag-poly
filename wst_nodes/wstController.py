    The Controller Class is the primary node from an ISY perspective. It is a Superclass
    of polyinterface.Node so all methods from polyinterface.Node are available to this
    class as well.

    Class Variables:
    self.nodes: Dictionary of nodes. Includes the Controller node. Keys are the node addresses
    self.name: String name of the node
    self.address: String Address of Node, must be less than 14 characters (ISY limitation)
    self.polyConfig: Full JSON config dictionary received from Polyglot for the controller Node
    self.added: Boolean Confirmed added to ISY as primary node
    self.config: Dictionary, this node's Config

    Class Methods (not including the Node methods):
    start(): Once the NodeServer config is received from Polyglot this method is automatically called.
    addNode(polyinterface.Node, update = False): Adds Node to self.nodes and polyglot/ISY. This is called
        for you on the controller itself. Update = True overwrites the existing Node data.
    updateNode(polyinterface.Node): Overwrites the existing node data here and on Polyglot.
    delNode(address): Deletes a Node from the self.nodes/polyglot and ISY. Address is the Node's Address
    longPoll(): Runs every longPoll seconds (set initially in the server.json or default 10 seconds)
    shortPoll(): Runs every shortPoll seconds (set initially in the server.json or default 30 seconds)
    query(): Queries and reports ALL drivers for ALL nodes to the ISY.
    getDriver('ST'): gets the current value from Polyglot for driver 'ST' returns a STRING, cast as needed
    runForever(): Easy way to run forever without maxing your CPU or doing some silly 'time.sleep' nonsense
                  this joins the underlying queue query thread and just waits for it to terminate
                  which never happens.
